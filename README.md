**Abstract:** 
"Abstract
The dominant paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its AI-augmented variants (RLAIF), is fundamentally constrained by its dependence on costly, static, and often miscalibrated external feedback mechanisms. This reliance introduces critical failure modes, including reward hacking, synthetic data drift, and an inability to resolve fine-grained preference distinctions—the Trivial Contrast Problem. We introduce the Adversarial Reflection-Optimized Preference (AROP) framework, a novel self-supervised alignment algorithm that enables an LLM policy to autonomously generate, critique, and refine its outputs within a closed-loop system, eliminating the need for any external preference models or human annotators. AROP operationalizes a policy's intrinsic reasoning capabilities to synthesize max-margin adversarial preference pairs on-the-fly, compelling the model to learn robust and precise alignment boundaries. We formalize a theoretically grounded extension to the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss, incorporating a self-generated dynamic margin. Empirical evaluations on safety and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AROP achieves superior alignment fidelity, robustness against adversarial jailbreaks, and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This work establishes a pathway toward truly autonomous, scalable, and stable alignment of frontier AI systems."
